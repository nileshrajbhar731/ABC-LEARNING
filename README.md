# ABC-LEARNING

It's a website project with several pages (Home page, About page, Contact page, Privacy policy, Sitemap) as well as a login and registration function with Javascript validation.
Using the Visual Studio Code IDE, I created an ABC Learning site.
HTML and CSS were utilised. Javascript
This was my first website, which I hosted on localhost using the Apache server.
